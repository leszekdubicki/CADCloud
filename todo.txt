ideas to improvement:
1. send the whole tree to the server for linking
2. add sketch segments and all dimensions to the tree also so it's easier
3. add possibility / example to use with checking/audit activities
4. implement version control
5. file/components/subparts names - resolve them dynamically so cc updates them correctly even though the assembly were pack and went somewhere
6. when packandgone - allog adding branch to the cc to make changes in the configuration model (new project)
